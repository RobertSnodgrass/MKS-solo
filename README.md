# MVP (Solo) Project

### Overview:

You have 36 hours to produce something compelling using the skills you've honed over the past five weeks. 

__Q:__ What are your inputs?
<br>
__A:__ 36 hours of (relatively) undivided attention

__Q:__ What is the required output?
<br>
__A:__ A compelling product presentation delivered to your classmates.


### Getting Started:

To build on your learning of core engineering concepts, we will begin thinking about how to actually manage projects. Engineering management is a deep skill and discipline with lots of history and academic writing. We will focus on just some highlights of content to give a very brief context of how we arrive here.

* Use an [Iterative and incremental development process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development) instead of a [Waterfall Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)

<!--
*  [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) - is a modern eveolution of Iterative and Incremental Development (IID) that further formalizes the IID philosophy with a set of principles and best practices. It also applies Lean Manufacturing process like [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban).-->

<!--* [Lean Product Process](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) - Takes the essence of Agile Development methodology and applies it more broadly to the development of product and buiness models that support he requirements of the project.
-->


## Basic Requirements
- [X] Fork the repo
- Complete the PRESS-RELEASE.md template (<30min)
  - [X] Pick an idea (implement a technology, build a product, make art, etc).
  - [X] Write it down on paper
  - [X] Imagine what portion of this could be done in 24 hours.
  - [X] Cut the scope in half.
  - [X] Cut the above scope in half again.
  - [X] Fill in the README.md template document
- [X] Use iterative development (go straight to something that demos your idea)
- [X] Prepare for pitch @ demo on Tuesday


## Extra Credit

- [ ] Storage - if your app persists data, use a tool like Parse or Firebase. 
- [X] If applicable, use an MVC Framework - Make your app production grade with a full-on MVC.

# Node Catapult

A boilerplate starter project that includes Node, Express, Browserify, and Mithril:

* Minimal - Understand everything.
* Efficient - Great defaults for development and production.
* Rapid - Get started immediately.

## Getting Started

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mindeavor/node-catapult my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Now visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

## Browserify Middleware

The most notable part of this app is [browserify-middleware](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/browserify-middleware). Great node packages are exceedingly rare â€“ this is one of those packages.
